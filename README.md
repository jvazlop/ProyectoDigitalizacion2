## Motivation

This project was born from a personal need: I often found myself unsure of what to watch or read next. Most recommendation systems didn’t align well with my tastes or weren’t customizable enough. 
That's why I built this application — a system where you can save your favorite movies and series, and receive personalized recommendations powered by AI. 
The goal is to enhance your viewing and reading experience by suggesting content that truly matches your preferences.

## Features

- Save and manage a personal collection of books and movies.
- Receive intelligent recommendations using AI.
- Export and import your watchlist(Thanks to XML).

## Deployment Instructions

- Python 3.8+

### Running Locally
